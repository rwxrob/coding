= Coding from the Get Go
Learn practical computer science and programming with Go as a first language

This is the current running notes from the livestream sessions learning practical computer science and programming with Go as a first language.

== Get organized
:tags: module, package, file, go.mod, pkg, cmd, README.adoc

- Package is the current directory name
- All `.go` files in directory as as if they were all in a single file
- Unit test files have `_test.go` (but more on that later)
- By convention, `main.go` contains `func main()` (also `package main`)
- All packages are either _commands_ or _libraries_
- Put library packages into `pkg`
- Put command packages into `cmd`
- A _module_ contains one or more packages
- Keep `go.mod` (which identifies the top of the _module_) at the root
- Regularly use `go mod tidy` to remove unused module dependencies
- Commit `go.mod` and `go.sum` in your GitHub repos
- Make sure command packages have good names
- Build binaries in same directory with `go build`
- Build binary with specific name with `go build -o hello`
- Install into `GOBIN` (in `PATH`) with `go install`
- Use `type hello` to see what is being run
- Use `hash -r` to reset to latest install
- Note that `go install` required full path to file `go install ./cmd/hello`
- Go is an _explicitly_ compiled language (like C)
- Comment a single line with `//`
- Comment multiple lines with `/* */`
- Create same-named file with `_test` for unit tests
- Add `// Output:` comment followed by expected output as `//` comment
- Run `go test` to check example-based unit test

== How long will it take?

Anticipate about {hours_mentor} hours of time with a mentor going over the material and know that you will need another {hours_self} on your own studying to master just these concepts and mini-projects. That's {hours_total} total hours (give or take) equivalent to a 5 <<ref-credit-hours, credit hour>> ({hours_week} hours per week) course if crammed over 15 weeks. 

Remember also that these mini-projects are just to introduce you to the many possibilities. None of these projects stand on their own as worthy of an addition to a portfolio, but they give you a great head start to make your own. You will still need at least another {hours_total} working on real projects—your own or others—after you have learned these before you will be ready to do any of this on your own professionally.

Learning to code isn't easy, it's just worth it.

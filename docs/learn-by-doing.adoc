Do these _mnemonic mini-projects_ in order to learn everything the Go programming language has to offer as well as the core concepts of computer science. These challenges are designed to be memorable so that you associate concepts with whatever silly mnemonic devices were associated with the challenge. Each challenge is designed for you to research on your own and then solve and document in your own way. The idea is that _you_ are writing your own codebook repo while you work through these summarizing the key concepts and code in your own way. You'll remember everything a lot better this way and can continue to expand your own codebook as you add your own challenges and learning. If you use AsciiDoc to write it, you can even publish your own booklet for reference or create your own EPUB or PDF you can carry with you on your phone of tablet.
